# Python-Final-Project


INTRODUCTION: 

Nowadays with the increasing demand for cabs in urban cities, it is becoming difficult to estimate the factors contributing to the dynamic fare price change. So to overcome this challenge we came up with an objective to build a comprehensive trip fare prediction model. It will analyze and predict the dynamic pricing of taxi services in New York City based on location, seasonal and temporal features.
